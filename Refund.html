          <h2>All the flex you need: changes and cancellations</h2>
          <p>We know flexibility is more important than ever. That's why we're offering unlimited changes and waiving the change fee, and providing the option to postpone or cancel your order and opt for a credit gift card with no cancellation fee, provided you adhere to our minimum notice of 48 hours before your scheduled pickup, delivery or dispatch time.</p>
        </div>
      
        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>Minimum notice required for changes or cancellations?</h2>
          <p>We operate with a minimum notice period which is 48 hours prior to your scheduled pickup, delivery or dispatch time.</p>
        </div>
      
        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>What are my options if I need to make changes?</h2>
          <p>Providing you are not within the minimum notice period as per above, you have three options:</p>
          <ul class="policy-options">
            <li>
              <h3>1. Postpone your order</h3>
              <p>Postpone your order until further notice. You can then reach out to our team at a later date when you know the date you'd like your order for. This is great for customers that want the same order at a later date and saves you from having to go through the re-ordering process again.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>2. Cancel for gift card</h3>
              <p>Cancel your order and receive a gift card equal to the amount you've paid. You'll receive the gift card via email or sms (or both if you're lucky!). You can add the gift card into your apple wallet or simply save the unique code as it will be needed to redeem the voucher either in-store or online (enter during checkout). Valid for 3 years and able to be used over multiple transactions. Best of all, if you lose it, we can re-send it anytime!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>3. Cancel with refund</h3>
              <p>Cancel your order and request a refund less our cancellation fee. As per our terms and conditions, Cake Creations by Kate will retain a cancellation fee of fifty percent (50%) of your order total. This is to cover: admin costs incurred to administer your order, cost of goods including payments made in advance to suppliers, the cost of losing sales which could have been taken for your scheduled pickup/delivery date, staff wages and additional costs incurred with the production of your order. If your order contains a pre-payment, the pre-payment will be applied to cover the fifty percent (50%) order cancellation fee. Any balance will be paid to you via the method you originally paid us.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
